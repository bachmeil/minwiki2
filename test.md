# Test file

I'm going to test if this works.

- It has various options.
- It's not fully documented.
- I'd like to be able to extend it if I can.
  - Extensions might need to take the form of preprocessing and postprocessing the file.

```
print("how are you?");
print(3+4.7);
```

Inline code: `writeln("Barney loves us all!!!");`

This is an inline equation: $y_{t} = \xi_{t}$.

This is a displayed equation:
$$x_{t} = \frac{\varepsilon_{t}}{\nu_{t}}$$

Task lists:

- [ ] Do something.
- [x] This was done.
